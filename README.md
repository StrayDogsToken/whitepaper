STRAY DOGS | $SYDOGS

1. Project Story
‚ÄúFrom the Streets to the Blockchain: Changing Lives With Every Transaction.‚Äù
In a world where memecoins try to fit into fictional lineages, Stray Dogs | $SYDOGS stands apart.
It doesn‚Äôt aim to be ‚Äúthe next‚Äù anything. It was born on the streets, from struggle and resilience. Its strength doesn‚Äôt come from empty promises, but from the community.
Unlike other tokens that use a dog‚Äôs image only as marketing, Stray Dogs has a real purpose: every action inside the ecosystem helps shelters and rescuers, giving visibility to dogs and generating real impact.
Here, every holder is not just an investor: they are a protector, an ally, a member of the pack.

2. Executive Summary
Stray Dogs ($SYDOGS) is a token built on BNB Chain with an innovative model:
‚Ä¢	0% taxes on buys and sells.
‚Ä¢	Deflationary model tied to the Solidarity Marketplace (every purchase burns SYDOGS).
‚Ä¢	Real ecosystem: Utility NFTs, Merchandising, Solidarity Platform, and SYDOGS App.
‚Ä¢	Mission: transform every transaction into verifiable help for those who rescue and protect dogs.

3. Global Problem
Millions of dogs live on the streets worldwide.
Shelters survive with scarce resources, without visibility or stable support.
SYDOGS does not ‚Äúrescue dogs‚Äù directly: its mission is to strengthen those who already rescue them with visibility, resources, and a global community.
